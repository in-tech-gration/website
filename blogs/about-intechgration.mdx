## How it all started

It all started when **Abed Hamami** and **Sohail Haqyar** decided to start a free coding school for refugees in Athens, Greece. Both of them self-taught software developers and refugees from war-torn Syria and Afghanistan respectively, decided to take their software skills and working experience to the next humanitarian level and set up a small evening class for people who wanted to take a chance on **new promising careers in tech**.

![Map](/images/map.png)

Together with a group of **motivated and passionate volunteers** who responded to their call for action, they came up with the idea of helping people who belong to socially vulnerable groups, integrate into the social fabric of their host countries through technology, and more specifically, by acquiring the software skills in high demand by the job market. This includes web technologies such as **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React** and other.

Then, [EchoHub Athens](https://www.facebook.com/ECHOHUBAthens/), a non-profit organization situated in Kypseli –one of Athens' crowdest and poorest neighborhoods–  came along and responded to their call and decided to freely provide the necessary space, hardware and Internet access for the lessons to take place.

**Thus, intechgration.io was born!**

![People Coding](/images/people-coding.png)

From **2022 to 2023**, the team of intechgration.io ran 2 cohorts of students and guided them through the misty and fascinating subject of Web development, sharing the skills and expertise required to build and develop web sites and web applications thus opening the way to getting hired by tech companies that are in high need for such skills.

In June 2023, **Kostas Minaidis**, a long-time volunteer and tech instructor joined the team as a full-time course instructor and content creator. At that point, a new turn for the project was taken and things started evolving at a faster, more serious pace. The idea was to create a free educational platform and an open source curriculum from the grounds up. This was the beginning of the **WDX-180° project**.

## What is WDX-180°?

Running a coding school is a pretty challenging task to say the least. Previous experience has shown that a thoroughly planned, peer-reviewed and well-structured curriculum needs to be at the core of the learning experience. On top of that, students need to have a central point of reference: an educational platform that will provide all the necessary material and required tools for guiding them through their learning journey while at the same time giving them a consistent user experience. Think of the experience one gets when enrolling in a course on the Coursera, Udacity or Edx platforms.

Out of these requirements and needs, we decided to **create the [WDX project](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/)**. Here are some of its aspects:
- An (always) **free and open source** Web Development curriculum and platform
- **A set of tools** that helps mentors, volunteers and instructors manage students and have a general overview of the learning process. This same set of tools will also help people who decide to follow the course as individuals and at their own pace.
- An **offline-ready** school-in-a-repo*. Everything a student or teacher needs can be copied and run locally to a computer. This means a student can watch lectures offline and even develop web applications in a local networked environment without Internet access. (Check the “School-in-a-repo” sub-section under “Our Goals” section below for more)
- A method of progressive learning, providing the students with a way to discover Frontend development in its entirety, including web languages, command line skills, collaborative working, project management and more.

> _*A repository, or repo for short, is just a project folder that includes a way of tracking changes and providing a history of these changes. Think of the undo/redo feature found in most applications but for any folder on your system._

## Taking intechgration to the next level

On another level, the team decided to pivot from the initial target groups (refugees, immigrants) **towards more inclusive goals**. Starting from our third cohort (October 2023) we decided to open up the doors towards tech skills and market integration for people with disabilities and in general we want to support and educate people from all sorts of underserved social groups. We’re thinking of people affected by the justice system, people with a history of substance abuse, victims of domestic violence and more. 

In September 2023, **Asteris Giannoudis** joined the team as an accessibility consultant, developer and teacher assistant. We started working towards making our content and platform more accessible and reaching out to people and groups that work with disabilities and invite them to participate.

## How does teaching/learning work in intechgration?

- Teaching relies mostly on volunteer mentors that support the students through regular lectures, meetings and presence on our Slack forum. There’s also a **dedicated lead instructor** for day to day activities and lectures but we try to **reach out to as many volunteers as possible**, since the tasks of the lead instructor are pretty heavy.
- Learning relies heavily on students forming groups and pairs and collaborating on the daily tasks and various projects. 
- The students are following the curriculum through the [WDX180 platform](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/) which contains the syllabus and provides the learning material and resources, interactive tools and exercises and everything that they need in their journey to become familiar with Web technologies and computing.   
- The WDX180 curriculum is split into 3 parts (trimesters). Here’s how it works:
- The first part (Beginner) is an online 

{/* WiP */}
- Peer-to-peer distribution of the learning material, including sharing media, rich Q&A sessions, and familiarizing with self-intact.
- Establishing a network of mentors, in a loose relationship with the project, a ”tank” of individuals that can always decide to get involved further or more actively in the future.
- (Group meetings -that are being recorded- where students meet and tackle challenges together)
{/* WiP */}

## Our goals

- **School-in-a-repo** (or education-on-a-USB-stick, we still haven’t decided on a name): provides full offline access to developer resources such as the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) documentation pages, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/20/introducing-the-overflow-offline-project/) and other useful resources that are commonly accessed through the Internet along with all the required material (curriculum, articles, exercises, self-assessment tools and more).
- On top of these resources, we intend to provide a tiny simulated Internet environment on the students’ computers so that they can keep experimenting with web technologies, even without Internet access. This environment will include its own Domain Name System (DNS), Content Delivery Network (CDN) for common CSS and JS libraries (e.g. Tailwind, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) an [offline local npm repository](https://github.com/local-npm/local-npm) and more. This will make WDX the perfect educational platform for places with unstable or costly Internet connection, or even places without Internet connection at all **such as prisons**. (For more on this, you can read the stories of [Jessica Hicklin](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/07/jessica-hicklin-transitioned-prison-free), [Rick Wolter](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-to-go-from-convict-to-coder) and [Jason Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNZZsRDzrNA) -among others- that inspired us.

## Our tech

_(This section is intended for tech people and software developers who would like to know more about the technical details and the technologies involved in the project)_

- [WDX180](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/): A free, open-source online platform for learning Web Development. Some tools that we have developed and/or integrated include:
 - An integrated [browser-based Linux VM](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/resources/vm/jslinux/index.html) (Virtual Machine) for teaching command line tools on Linux-based environments. 
 - A specialized user folder where students can submit their exercises and have automated tests run upon submission (through GitHub actions). This helps our students get immediate feedback on their submitted code.
 - A Markdown [validator tool](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/tools/validator.js) which helps content creators and curators compile documents that are ready for integrating into the curriculum.
 - Our own custom [yari parser tool](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/tools/yari.parser.js) for integrating content from MDN. 
 - [A tool](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/tools/resources.js) for managing and searching through our curated content and resources.
 - All of the reviewed content (YouTube videos, articles, tutorials, etc.) is stored in a schema-validated [JSON structure](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/resources/resources.json). This is the first step into making this content searchable and filterable through an integrated search engine (work in progress) and also make it easy for contributors to submit properly-structured resources.  
- [KipTrak](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/kiptrak): a student progress tracking tool for the instructors
- [sgen](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/sgen): a Syllabus Generation tool
- [study-lenses](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/study-lenses) (v2): We integrated and improved this great tool that helps beginners see the code in many different ways. Study lenses adds new perspectives and layers of interactivity on top of existing code, making it a great tool for educators and students. Just copy and paste any existing JavaScript code, and the tool instantly provides various ways to see and experiment with the code.

## Our core principles

{/* WiP */}
Open Source & Open Source contribution, Open Education, free -as in freedom, not as in free beer-, inclusivity, accessibility, social responsibility, ethical considerations and more

- Our open source contributions (MDN, Rainbow CSV, VSCode extensions, Chrome extension, etc.
{/* WiP */}

## What we provide to the community

## A Year in Review: What did we achieve in 2023*?

_(*with 0 budget and 2½ staff members)_

- **Recreated the Web Development course from scratch**: We turned what was in the past a part-time evening activity into a full-blown 9-month, weekly course. We moved from part-time volunteers to a fully-dedicated instructor for our cohort. Our new course is called **Web Development X - 180** (or WDX180 for short).

![Hungry for coding?](/images/hungry-for-coding.jpg)

- **Created a brand [new website](https://intechgration.io/)**. (based on NextJS)
- **Research and Development**: we’ve been really busy researching and developing a multitude of tools and software that helps the team and the students thrive. Make sure to check out the [Development section](#development) below for a detailed overview of the R&D activity at intechgration. Our toolkit includes the Syllabus Generator (SGEN), the WDX Extension Pack, a Chrome Extension, KipTrack, Instructor Cockpit, yariX parser, Flexbox Bunnies game and more.
- **We’ve partnered with the [DeNepo](https://github.com/DeNepo) team** and started integrating their open source material and tools (check study-lenses) into our WDX course. We started collaborating with **[Evan Cole](https://github.com/colevandersWands)**, **[Tamer Almurshidi](https://github.com/talmurshidi)** and **[Yoshi Malaise](https://github.com/yoshimalaise)**, all of which have been supporting us right from the beginning ❤️. At least two repositories from DeNepo have already been integrated into WDX180 and are maintained by the community: [welcome-to-javascript](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/welcome-to-javascript) and [inside-javascript](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/inside-javascript).
- **Had our 3rd cohort complete the first part of the WDX180 course**. Check out our [celebratory online gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKxPBpYe2Wk).
 - On October the 2nd of 2023, our 3rd cohort of enrolled students started the WDX180 course which is a 9-month long course on Web Development. On December 22 of the same year, our students celebrated the completion of the first part/trimester of the course (Introductory) and will be joining back in January for the second trimester (intermediate).

![Celebratory Online Gathering](/images/cohort-02-part-01-celebration.jpg)

- **Recorded and published 42 videos, totalling almost 16 and a half hours of free** YouTube educational material. From learning what an API is to becoming familiar with CSS Flexbox and VSCode all the way to video editing.
 - [“Flappy Bird” tutorial YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agEmTY9xT7EvzUkClAeAHJr9G): **17 videos, 3 hours**
 - [Video Editing with DaVinci Resolve YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agEnXi6yeNlRIltLpMIcrVatC): **2 videos, 17 minutes**

### Development

- **Developed a Syllabus Generation tool** (aka SGEN): You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/sgen) (under heavy development at the moment). This tool is used to generate the Syllabus and curriculum for the WDX180 course but the intention is to be able to use the tool in any kind of educational context. The tool helps you build a website from simple plain text Markdown files and are easily configurable through YAML configuration files.
- **Recreated our main website from scratch**. You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/website) (still an ongoing process) and access the website from this link: [https://intechgration.io](https://intechgration.io/)
- **Developed the [WDX Extension Pack](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/VSCode-WDX-Extension-Pack)**, a [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kostasx.vscode-wdx-extension-pack) that helps students attending the WDX180 course get started with many useful extensions and tools. We have also created [another VSCode extension](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/VSCode-WDX-Development-Extension), specifically for developers working on the WDX course.
- **Developing a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/Chrome.New.Tab.Extension)** for quickly accessing common links and resources
- **Started developing KipTrak**, a student progress tracking software. In the process, we started recording and sharing this real-life development process through a dedicated [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agElB29_USaEp_wtd2cPuD71C) called “Real-life coding”. You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/kiptrak). You can find more about the development of the project (and also contribute) through our [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/in-tech-gration/projects/4).
- **Developed Instructor Cockpit**, a tool that helps instructors track their students’ progress and GitHub activity among other things. 
- **Developed [JavaScript Animated](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/JavaScript.Animated/dev/index.html)**, a visual, interactive guide to JavaScript array methods. In the future, we hope to provide more interactive and animated guides to all things JavaScript. You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/JavaScript.Animated).
- **Developed [Learn Flexbox](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/learn-flexbox)** (aka Flexbox Bunnies): an interactive game to help beginners in Frontend development learn all about the CSS Flexbox properties.
- **Developing a toolset called DreamX** whose main purpose is to let anyone create an open source curriculum from scratch or create their own version of the WDX180 curriculum to fit their own needs and style, e.g. turn it from a 9-month course to a 6-month course, etc. 
- **Forked and developed the next generation of the study-lenses tool** by DeNepo. We’ve partnered with [DeNepo](https://github.com/DeNepo) and started developing a special version of their [study-lenses](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/study-lenses) tool to fit the purposes and requirements of the WDX180 course.

### Content creation

- **Design and develop the Web Development X curriculum**: Our 9-month Web development course, codenamed [WDX180](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180),  is available to enrolled students and anyone who would like to take the course in a self-paced autonomous mode. The curriculum is still work in progress as we are currently battle-testing it with our current cohort of students. The curriculum is available as a website, hosted on GitHub pages. You can always access the [website for free here](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/). There’s an open Discussion forum [over here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/discussions) and a list of tasks [right here](https://github.com/orgs/in-tech-gration/projects/3).
- **We created the [Flappy Bird guide](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/css/misc/flappy_app_practice/index.html)** which guides beginners through the process of implementing a web page based on a design (mockup)  from scratch. The guide is accompanied by **[3 hours of walkthrough videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agEmTY9xT7EvzUkClAeAHJr9G)**. 
- **A Murder Mystery game for learning how to work with Databases**: we forked the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) game and turned it into an atmospheric mystery game with music, visuals and a darker style. The goal of [Database Murder Mystery](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/database-mysteries/) is to turn it into a gamified educational experience, through which students will learn about relational and NoSQL databases. We are in the process of creating a NoSQL version of the game, so feel free to reach out to us if you are interested in contributing to the project. 
- **Integrated the free version of DaVinci Resolve** video editing software to our workflow and started sharing our insights through a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agEnXi6yeNlRIltLpMIcrVatC) dedicated to the software.
- **Created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/Redux-from-Scratch)** containing the code from Tejas Kumar’s Redux from Scratch [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g1f0j5Qk8A).

### Open Source Contributions

- **Accessibility improvements for Rainbow CSV**: As part of our instructor/student toolkit, we use the [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) VSCode extension to extensively work with CSV files. Earlier this year (2023) we created a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mechatroner/vscode_rainbow_csv/pull/147) with some accessibility improvements to the User Interface. The PR was accepted, merged and is now part of the extension.
- **DeNepo curriculum & tools**: we have already forked and integrated several repositories from the DeNepo organization into our curriculum and platform and we are constantly revising and improving the content. We have also started working on an improved version of the [study-lenses](https://github.com/DeNepo/study-lenses) educational tool. 
- Since our curriculum is based around the **MDN docs**, we are constantly providing feedback and revising their content through frequent [Pull Requests](https://github.com/mdn/content/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akostasx+is%3Aclosed).
- We are frequent contributors to platforms that help other developers understand programming concepts, fix bugs and solve code-related challenges like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4861760/kostas-minaidis) and [CodeGrepper](https://www.grepper.com/profile/kostas-minaidis).

- **Employ part-time and/or full-time developers and educators** to expand our services, support evening classes and accelerate the development process of our open source tools and curriculum.

## What are we planning for 2024?

- We are planning to **live-stream all of our daily lectures** and coding sessions.
- We have been working on a project called **Training Wheels for Programmers** (aka NewbieScript) that includes a series of tools, tips, recommended practices and code libraries, specifically oriented for beginners in Web development. Think of training wheels for programmers. Let’s face it: learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript is pretty hard. Part of the reason is that these languages have some inherent characteristics that make it very hard for beginners to begin their journey. Weird syntax (e.g. atob vs getElementsByClassName), ambiguity (e.g. innerText vs textContent), a multitude of ways to do the same thing (e.g. onclick, addEventListener, event attributes) and other aspects of the computer languages and tools involved are some examples of the obstacles faced by newcomers. Training Wheels provide beginner-friendly alternatives for most of these cases as well as best practices that will let beginners avoid common mistakes and help them become better programmers right from the start. You can follow our progress through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/twheels). Stay tuned for the updates.
- **We are planning to share our experience, tools, tips and insights** with the educational and open-source community and everyone who is interested in teaching Computer Science, Software Engineering and Web Development. We’ve already established [a home for these resources](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/Educators), stay tuned. This repository will also include tips and recommended practices for anyone willing to teach the WDX180 course.  
- We are planning to **collaborate with similar projects**, for example we are currently in communication with [Sistech](https://sis.tech/) and are looking forward to joining forces with other socially-centered tech-related initiatives. 
- Our ambition is to turn WDX180 into an open-source LMS ([Learning Management System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Learning_management_system))
- Looking forward to hearing your suggestions and ideas!
