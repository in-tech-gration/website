faqs:
  - question: >-
      How do I enrol in the WDX 180Â° course?
    answer: >-
      You have to apply through our <a href="apply" target="_blank" class="font-bold underline">application form</a> and we will contact you with more details shortly after you've submitted your application.
  - question: >-
      Do I need prior coding experience to qualify?
    answer: >-
      Coding knowledge is not a prerequisite. However, it is considered a big plus. If you do have some experience, it will impact your acceptance decision and will give you a head start.
  - question: >-
      Will I be able to attend the course on-site?
    answer: >-
      The Core part of the program (2nd phase which happen to be the middle 3 months) will take place in-person in Kypseli. If you are a wheel-chair user, you will be attending the course remotely as unfortunately our space isn't accessible. However, we are on the lookout for an accessible space and we'll make an announcement once we find one.
  - question: >-
      Is it really free? Are there any hidden fees?
    answer: >-
      Our course is 100% free of charge and our curriculum is open source. There are no additional or hidden fees whatsoever. We're just a group of techies that wanna pay it forwardðŸ˜‰.
  - question: >-
      Am I eligible for the course? (What qualifies me to get accepted into the
      course?)
    answer: >-
      Currently, our course is offered to underserved communities and groups
      that struggle due to discrimination, war, harsh social and economic
      conditions. Such groups include: refugees, asylum seekers, migrants,
      people with disabilities, former inmates, and other struggling groups that
      reside in countries within the following timezones: GMT+2, GMT+3, GMT+4.
  - question: Are all types of disabilities included in this course?
    answer: >-
      At this time, the course can be attended remotely by people with mobility
      impairments (such as wheelchair users, people with lower limb
      amputations). Soon we will have access to an accessible space, so that
      everyone can attend the courses in person. As we are unable to provide
      support for other types of impairments (e.g.blind,deaf and hard of
      hearing), we can only guarantee that a specific group of the disabled
      community can have a seamless experience of the course. However, if you
      are a disabled person, not in the aforementioned group, do not hesitate to
      contact us and maybe we can find a way!
  - question: How is the course structured?
    answer: >-
      The course is based on our open source Web Development X (WDX) curriculum.
      The course spans 9 months in total and <b>requires at least 4 to 5
      hours</b> of commitment (study and practice) on a daily basis.
